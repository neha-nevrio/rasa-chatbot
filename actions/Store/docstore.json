While Star Wars takes place in a galaxy far, far away, the possibility of machines speaking to us and answering our questions in a human-like manner is already a reality that is becoming more real by the day. Search engines like Alexa and Echo, as well as smart assistants like them, are examples. Even online calls have one thing in common: robots make them all.You're probably wondering how they manage to appear so human-like if they're not human. How do they respond so intelligently to me? How do they manage to be so articulate?This my friends is the magic ofNatural Language ProcessingNatural Language Processing, also known as NLP, is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables machines to read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages. NLP combines linguistics and computer science to decipher language structure and guidelines and to create models capable of comprehending breakdown and separating significant details from text and speech.Every day, humans interact with one another via public social media, exchanging massive amounts of freely available data. This information is extremely helpful in comprehending human behaviour and customer habits.Data analysts and machine learning experts use this data to teach machines to mimic human linguistic behaviour, which saves millions in terms of manpower and time because a person is not always required on the other end of the phone.Natural Language Processing is also a lot more widespread than you may realise we use it every day in seemingly normal and insignificant situations.Dont know how to correctly spell a word, autocorrect has you covered.If you want to discover if your article or thesis will be tagged for plagiarism, a plagiarism checker will scan the web and find any occurrences of published papers that may match your work line by line.How does it work?While NLP appears to be a fun technological concept, it is a cutting-edge and complex technology concept. It's really simple to learn; you start with a paper or an article to help your algorithm comprehend what's going on, and then you turn it into a machine-readable format. This is like forcing a toddler to learn to read for the first time.Steps :You begin by segmenting the text, which means breaking it down into its constituent sentences. You can accomplish this by segmenting the article along its punctuation, such as full stops and commas, so that the algorithm can interpret these phrases. We obtain the words in a sentence and explain them to our algorithm individually.So, we break down our sentences into their constituent words and store them. This is called tokenizing where each word is called a token.We can speed up the learning process by removing non-essential words that add little significance to our statement but serve to make it sound more unified. Stop words include words like \"are\", \"and\", and \"the\".Now that we have the fundamental structure of our paper, we must explain it to our computer.

Stop words include words like \"are\", \"and\", and \"the\".Now that we have the fundamental structure of our paper, we must explain it to our computer. We begin by clarifying that some words, such as skipping, skips, and skipped, are the same word with different prefixes and suffixes. This is known as stemming.We also identify the root words for various words, tenses, moods, gender, and so on. This is known as lemmatization, after the basic word lemma.By adding these tags to our words, we can now explain to the machine the concept of nouns, verbs, articles, and other components of speech. This is referred to as part of speech tagging.Following that, we introduce our machine to pop culture references and ordinary names by highlighting names of movies, prominent people or places, and so on that may appear in the document. This is known as entity tagging.Once we have our base words and tags, we apply a machine-learning approach like Nave Bayes to train our model, human sentiment, and speech. At the end of the day, the majority of NLP approaches are straightforward grammar techniques that we were taught in school.NLP Applications:-Natural Language Processing (NLP) has several practical applications in a wide range of industries. Some of the most common NLP applications are as follows:1. Sentiment Analysis: NLP can be used to analyse the sentiment or emotion communicated in text data like as reviews, social media posts, and customer feedback. This can assist businesses in better understanding client preferences and increasing customer satisfaction.2. Chatbots: Natural language processing (NLP) can be used to develop chatbots, which are computer programs that use natural language to interact with humans. Chatbots can be used in customer service to provide  support and answer frequently asked inquiries 24 hours a day, seven days a week.3. NLP can be used to develop speech recognition systems that can translate spoken language into text.4. NLP can be used to develop machine learning systems that can translate text from one language to another. Machine translation systems translate text using statistical or rule-based approaches.AuthorNeha BhartiHomeAbout usServicesPortfolioTestimonialsJobsBlogsContact usSubscribe to our newsletterThe latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.Email addressSubscribe 2022 Nevrio Technology Services.

It shortens and speeds up the UI development on Android which helps to get your apps to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs. It makes Android app designing faster and easier.Here is the some reasons to use jetpack compose for UI designing for androidBenefits of Jetpack compose1.  Interpretive UI designingIn Jetpack compose, we can design the screen without fetching the elements and content from another screen. We can simply design the UI with functionality without any extra code to fetch the views from xml.In xml we used data binding and view binding, which allows us to bind data directly to your  views without writing extra code but this process itself is tiresome to set up the process.Interpretive UI is when the state of the screen is predefined and when it listens to any changes made to the state then the UI elements get reloaded.2.  Recyclerview replaced by List ViewIn traditional Android development, ListView is one of the most commonly used UI components to display a list of items. With Jetpack Compose, however, there is a new and improved way to display lists called LazyColumn.Jetpack Compose, we can expect to see even more powerful and innovative apps being built for the Android platform.Disadvantages of Jetpack Compose1 - The main downside of this solution is that it re-rendering previews each time when code changes and builds are not that fast.\n2- Some features are still coming so some components are not", "doc_id": "d00f2f50-550c-4ac5-a0a4-0f319a30ebd7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0e04b828e5adc715e694420ef697c348175ff6735051b7b5ecf7de9524295180", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7882, "end": 12268}, "relationships": {"1": "07f1c946-e58b-4d2a-a0dd-216f81eb01f1", "2": "a77eb0ca-18a5-4241-b84c-a716c18c3298", "3": "07e2ccdf-5faa-4247-8510-5d6b8ce7d2b8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "07e2ccdf-5faa-4247-8510-5d6b8ce7d2b8": {"__data__": {"text": "your  views without writing extra code but this process itself is tiresome to set up the process.Interpretive UI is when the state of the screen is predefined and when it listens to any changes made to the state then the UI elements get reloaded.2.

The default template already contains some Compose elements.Example to write a function -@Composable: This annotation specifies the following method is using Jetpack compose for creating views.@Composablefun Introduction() {Text(text = \"Hello Compose\")}@Preview: This annotation will be used to show the preview in android studios design section.@Preview(showBackground = true)@Composablefun Preview() {ProjectTheme {Introduction()}}Few things to remember -1- Compose function names should  start with Capital letters.2- We use padding instead of margin to define the spacing.3- Compose works with Kotlin.AuthorAkanksha - Software DeveloperHomeAbout usServicesPortfolioTestimonialsJobsBlogsContact usSubscribe to our newsletterThe latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.Email addressSubscribe 2022 Nevrio Technology Services.

Whatever data you transfer to store virtually, becomes the responsibility of the third-party provider. The provider hosts secure, maintenance and ensures that you have access to the data whenever you need it.Cloud data storage provides so many benefits, from greater accessibility to data backups. It is very cost-effective, and it provides elasticity meaning you can scale up the capacity as your data volume increases and can dial down when needed.Cloud storage has large numbers of data servers to ensure the constant availability of data, thus if any server fails or requires maintenance then the user can use the other services available to transfer their data.Types of Cloud Storage- Cloud storage is a virtual hard drive, it has made it possible for everyone to store their data virtually and access it from anywhere whenever needed. Cloud storage is a versatile system that allows storing data as word documents, files, and in the form of video to access the cloud to process complex data and run applications. To decide which cloud storage is the best to use as per the requirement, lets have a look at the different types of cloud storage.1.

Cloud storage is a versatile system that allows storing data as word documents, files, and in the form of video to access the cloud to process complex data and run applications. To decide which cloud storage is the best to use as per the requirement, lets have a look at the different types of cloud storage.1. Private Cloud Storage- This cloud storage is also called enterprise cloud storage. This cloud runs on the organization's private network and is protected by one firewall. Companies can store their expensive and large data on this cloud and can scale up or dial down easily according to their need. The major advantage of storing data on private cloud storage is that it provides full control to its owner. The only drawback is that maintaining private cloud storage is its cost of maintenance.2. Public Cloud Storage- Public Cloud Storage is maintained or hosted by a different service provider. It can easily be accessed online by the users and anyone else who is authorized by the host. It has very fewer opportunities for customizing the security field because of the different service providers, the major public cloud storage providers are Google Cloud, Amazon Web Cloud, and IBM Cloud. Its very reliable, affordable, and has zero maintenance cloud storage. Small and mid-size companies can use this to store their data.3. Hybrid Cloud Storage- As its name suggests hybrid cloud storage is the combination of both public and private cloud storage. It allows users to store their data with the security of a private cloud and access or process it with the effect of a public cloud. Its security can easily be customized by the users. With the quality of both private cloud and public cloud, it is very affordable, user friendly, and has security features. Hybrid cloud storage is used by large, small, and mid-size companies.4. Community Cloud Storage- It is a variation of cloud storage, it provides solutions to specific communities. It provides security to users, so their private data can be secured, it also offers specific tools and features to meet the requirements of the community. This is affordable and easily scalable, it is a great option for health, finance, and legal companies who have strict compliance.Trends in Cloud Storage -1.Kubernetes Facilitating Blockchain-  Blockchain is a revolutionary technology and an open source, it provides a shared digital ledger that records accurate transaction data of two companies in a private or public network. It helps organizations to maintain their records accurately without being dependent on any centralized authority. It lets companies deploy and upgrade and maintain containerized infrastructure.2.Serverless Functions- Serverless cloud is also known as function - as - a - services (FAAS), it is a cloud computing model in which a provider manages the allocation of computer resources to meet the demand from running applications. Serverless Cloud uses a combination of our [CLI](https://www.serverless.com/cloud/docs/cli), [SDK (Serverless Development Kit)](https://www.serverless.com/cloud/docs/apps), and [Cloud Dashboard](https://www.serverless.com/cloud/docs/dashboard) to easily build, deploy, and monitor your applications.3.Growth in Cloud Gaming and AR/VR- In the coming years, we would be witnessing a huge outbreak in cloud gaming. Googles Stadia and Amazon Luna will shape the future of cloud gaming. The advancement of AR/Vr gaming has made the AR/VR headset (oculus) more accessible.The cloud-based AR/VR also helps in areas such as data visualization, product designing, etc. Cloud gaming is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years due to new models and hardware availability.4.AI in Cloud Gaming- In the next coming years, AI analytics will improve services, predict consumer behavior, and design monetization models. AI is also being applied to the development of novel game control systems. Technology companies will explore new ways to implement AI for Big Data processing, improving business functions and output.", "doc_id": "e9038bb4-b79b-4920-a9f1-a34897277ec4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "003d3028a4d288b22732c7954c88d4fbb93a99a3c21ce0ce0f1756f9fd4a655a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 47359, "end": 51874}, "relationships": {"1": "07f1c946-e58b-4d2a-a0dd-216f81eb01f1", "2": "07e746b1-d40f-43c6-a229-69e3ad976d85", "3": "bebdd3af-f7a1-41e5-b4a6-5831259a2da6"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "bebdd3af-f7a1-41e5-b4a6-5831259a2da6": {"__data__": {"text": "and monitor your applications.3.Growth in Cloud Gaming and AR/VR- In the coming years, we would be witnessing a huge outbreak in cloud gaming.
