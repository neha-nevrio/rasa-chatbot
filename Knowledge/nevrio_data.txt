FAQ
Which web application platform is right for me?
Choosing the right web application platform depends on various factors such as your specific project requirements, technical expertise, scalability needs, budget, and more. Here are some popular platforms and their key features to consider:
WordPress: Ideal for beginners and smaller projects. It’s user-friendly, has a vast array of themes and plugins, and is suitable for blogs, portfolios, and smaller business sites.
React.js/Vue.js: These are front-end frameworks for building single-page applications (SPAs). They offer great performance and interactivity but might require more technical expertise.
Django (Python): Offers high-level abstractions making it efficient for development. It’s well-suited for complex, data-driven websites.
To narrow down the options, consider:
Scalability: How much traffic do you expect? Will the platform handle growth?
Customization: Do you need extensive custom features or is out-of-the-box functionality sufficient?
Budget and Resources: Consider costs for development, hosting, and maintenance.
What does it cost to develop a web application?
Do you provide web app maintenance services?
I only want to revamp my existing web application, can I get it done?
Absolutely! Revamping an existing web application is entirely feasible. Whether you’re seeking a modernized design, improved functionality, enhanced user experience, or performance upgrades, it’s possible to revamp your current application. We’ll assess your existing app, understand your goals for the revamp, and work on redesigning, adding features, or optimizing the application to meet your requirements. With a clear vision and the right expertise, revamping your web app is achievable without starting from scratch.

FAQ
What Are the Different Types of Mobile Apps You Can Develop?
There are primarily three types of mobile apps based on their architecture and development approach:
 Native Apps:
 iOS Native Apps: Developed specifically for Apple’s iOS platform using programming languages like Swift or Objective-C.
 Android Native Apps: Built for Android devices using Java or Kotlin. They leverage the specific functionalities and design guidelines of the Android platform.
 Native apps offer high performance and access to device-specific features but require separate development for each platform.
 Hybrid Apps:Hybrid apps strike a balance, offering cross-platform compatibility with access to native device features but may have slightly lower performance compared to fully native apps. Hybrid Apps platforms are Flutter and ReactNative.
  Choosing the right type of app depends on factors like your target audience, required features, development timeline, and budget. Some projects might benefit from a combination of these approaches for maximum reach and functionality.
Can You Build Apps for Both iOS and Android?
What is the Difference Between Cross-Platform and Native App Development?
Can You Work With Us if We Don’t Have a Fully Formed Idea for Our App?

FAQ
Why do I need UI/UX design?
UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) are two integral components of design, each with distinct focuses. UI pertains to the visual elements and aesthetics of a product, encompassing elements like buttons, icons, and overall layout. It’s essentially the look and feel of the interface. On the other hand, UX is a broader concept, involving the entire user journey and interaction with the product. It considers user research, information architecture, and the overall satisfaction of the user. While UI concentrates on the surface-level design, UX delves deeper into creating a seamless and enjoyable experience for users throughout their interaction with the product. In essence, UI is about the presentation, and UX is about the holistic user journey, working in tandem to optimize both the visual appeal and functionality of a product.

FAQ
What is AR/VR development?
Augmented Reality (AR) enriches our real-world surroundings by layering digital content onto it, seamlessly blending the physical and digital realms. This technology enhances user experiences through devices like smartphones or AR glasses, allowing for interactive and context-aware information. On the other hand, Virtual Reality (VR) immerses users in entirely digital environments, isolating them from the physical world. Achieved through VR headsets, this technology offers a fully immersive experience, often utilized in gaming and simulations. While AR enhances our immediate reality, VR transports users to entirely different realms, each contributing to a diverse landscape of technological possibilities.

FAQ
How do I determine the right features for my MVP?
The primary purpose of creating an MVP is to test your business idea in the shortest possible time. Prioritizing features helps you identify what functionality you need to start working on as soon as possible to reduce the time to market and what functionalities may be added later in production.
What technologies will you use for building my MVP?















How do I manage expectations around an MVP?
Can I skip the MVP phase and develop the full product right away?
Skipping the MVP phase is possible, but it’s not advisable. The MVP allows you to test your product concept, gather user feedback, and identify potential issues with minimal investment. Developing the full product without this iterative process may lead to higher risks, increased development costs, and the possibility of building features that might not align with user needs or market demands. The MVP approach provides a more strategic and informed foundation for a successful and well-targeted final product.

Why SEO Remains Crucial?
SEO is the digital compass guiding your business to success. It’s the key to ensuring your website is discovered, your brand recognized, and your audience engaged, ultimately driving organic growth and establishing your online authority.
Organic Search Is a Primary Source of Website Traffic

Helps Build Trust and Credibility
People trust search engines, and if your website ranks high in search results, it can help build trust and credibility with your target audience. High search engine rankings indicate that your website is a relevant and authoritative source of information.
Improves User Experience and Engagement on Website
SEO involves optimizing your website’s structure and content to make it easy for search engines to understand and index your pages. This also improves the user experience by making your website more organized, informative, and user-friendly.
Cost-Effective
SEO is a cost-effective way to drive traffic to your website. Unlike paid advertising, which requires ongoing investment, SEO can provide long-term results with minimal ongoing costs.
Competitive Advantage
SEO is a highly competitive field, and businesses that invest in SEO can gain a competitive advantage over their competitors. By optimizing your website for search engines, you can attract more traffic and leads, which can lead to increased sales and revenue.

Posted on April 26, 2023 By Nevrio
Android’s modern toolkit for developing native UI is called Jetpack Compose. It shortens and speeds up the UI development on Android which helps to get your apps to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs. It makes Android app designing faster and easier.
Here is the some reasons to use jetpack compose for UI designing for android
Benefits of Jetpack compose
1. Interpretive UI designing
In Jetpack compose, we can design the screen without fetching the elements and content from another screen. We can simply design the UI with functionality without any extra code to fetch the views from xml.
In xml we used data binding and view binding, which allows us to bind data directly to your views without writing extra code but this process itself is tiresome to set up the process.
Interpretive UI is when the state of the screen is predefined and when it listens to any changes made to the state then the UI elements get reloaded.
2. Recyclerview replaced by List View
In traditional Android development, ListView is one of the most commonly used UI components to display a list of items. With Jetpack Compose, however, there is a new and improved way to display lists called LazyColumn.
Jetpack Compose, we can expect to see even more powerful and innovative apps being built for the Android platfor
Disadvantages of Jetpack Compose
1 – The main downside of this solution is that it re-rendering previews each time when code changes and builds are not that fast. 2- Some features are still coming so some components are not supported.
Setup Instructions
Create an app using the Empty Compose Activity template. The default template already contains some Compose elements.
Example to write a function –
@Composable: This annotation specifies the following method is using Jetpack compose for creating views.
@Composable
fun Introduction() {
Text(text = “Hello Compose”)
}
@Preview: This annotation will be used to show the preview in android studio’s design section.
@Preview(showBackground = true)
@Composable
fun Preview() {
ProjectTheme {
Introduction()
}
}
Few things to remember –
1- Compose function names should start with Capital letters.
2- We use padding instead of margin to define the spacing.
3- Compose works with Kotlin.

Posted on March 23, 2023 By Nevrio
Introduction to NLP:-
Fans of Star Wars will recognize C-3po, the golden, life-size robot hotelier. While Star Wars takes place in a galaxy far, far away, the possibility of machines speaking to us and answering our questions in a human-like manner is already a reality that is becoming more real by the day. Search engines like Alexa and Echo, as well as smart assistants like them, are examples. Even online calls have one thing in common: robots make them all.
You’re probably wondering how they manage to appear so human-like if they’re not human. How do they respond so intelligently to me? How do they manage to be so articulate?
This my friends is the magic of Natural Language Processing.
Natural Language Processing, also known as NLP, is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables machines to read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages. NLP combines linguistics and computer science to decipher language structure and guidelines and to create models capable of comprehending breakdown and separating significant details from text and speech.
Every day, humans interact with one another via public social media, exchanging massive amounts of freely available data. This information is extremely helpful in comprehending human behaviour and customer habits.
Data analysts and machine learning experts use this data to teach machines to mimic human linguistic behaviour, which saves millions in terms of manpower and time because a person is not always required on the other end of the phone.
Natural Language Processing is also a lot more widespread than you may realise we use it every day in seemingly normal and insignificant situations.
Don’t know how to correctly spell a word, autocorrect has you covered.
If you want to discover if your article or thesis will be tagged for plagiarism, a plagiarism checker will scan the web and find any occurrences of published papers that may match your work line by line.
How does it work?
While NLP appears to be a fun technological concept, it is a cutting-edge and complex technology concept. It’s really simple to learn; you start with a paper or an article to help your algorithm comprehend what’s going on, and then you turn it into a machine-readable format. This is like forcing a toddler to learn to read for the first time.
Steps :
You begin by segmenting the text, which means breaking it down into its constituent sentences. You can accomplish this by segmenting the article along its punctuation, such as full stops and commas, so that the algorithm can interpret these phrases. We obtain the words in a sentence and explain them to our algorithm individually.
So, we break down our sentences into their constituent words and store them. This is called tokenizing where each word is called a token.
We can speed up the learning process by removing non-essential words that add little significance to our statement but serve to make it sound more unified. Stop words include words like “are”, “and”, and “the”.
Now that we have the fundamental structure of our paper, we must explain it to our computer. We begin by clarifying that some words, such as skipping, skips, and skipped, are the same word with different prefixes and suffixes. This is known as stemming.
We also identify the root words for various words, tenses, moods, gender, and so on. This is known as lemmatization, after the basic word lemma.
By adding these tags to our words, we can now explain to the machine the concept of nouns, verbs, articles, and other components of speech. This is referred to as part of speech tagging.
Following that, we introduce our machine to pop culture references and ordinary names by highlighting names of movies, prominent people or places, and so on that may appear in the document. This is known as entity tagging.

Once we have our base words and tags, we apply a machine-learning approach like Naïve Bayes to train our model, human sentiment, and speech. At the end of the day, the majority of NLP approaches are straightforward grammar techniques that we were taught in school.
NLP Applications:-
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has several practical applications in a wide range of industries. Some of the most common NLP applications are as follows:
1. Sentiment Analysis: NLP can be used to analyse the sentiment or emotion communicated in text data like as reviews, social media posts, and customer feedback. This can assist businesses in better understanding client preferences and increasing customer satisfaction.
2. Chatbots: Natural language processing (NLP) can be used to develop chatbots, which are computer programs that use natural language to interact with humans. Chatbots can be used in customer service to provide support and answer frequently asked inquiries 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
3. NLP can be used to develop speech recognition systems that can translate spoken language into text.
4. NLP can be used to develop machine learning systems that can translate text from one language to another. Machine translation systems translate text using statistical or rule-based approaches.

Posted on September 8, 2022 By Nevrio
Introduction -
Microservices architecture is an approach to developing systems in which a single application is composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller services. These small services communicate through APIs, which ensure the security of the application. If the developer makes any updates in one small group, it won’t change the function of the whole application.
Many enterprises have adopted the microservices architecture. It has been an amazing, cost-effective method. Microservices growth started between 2011-2014, replacing the SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) and monolithic architecture. The global market value of microservices was $2,073 million in 2018 and is projected to reach $8,073 million by 2026, registering a CAGR of 18.6% from 2019 to 2026.
Microservices vs Monolithic -
Microservices made their way into the software development market some years ago, but they have made a superb impact. Microservices offer many attractive features over monoliths, as in microservices, every service has:
Its own CPU
A dedicated database
Can adapt to different technology stacks.
And can be maintained by a different team, so that they are easily manageable and overcomes the overhead of deploying the full code if there’s a change in one amongst the services. Whereas in Monolithic Architecture, every unit is tightly coupled & interdependent.
So microservices provide great flexibility in implementation while also implementing huge scalability.
Pros of microservices:
* Better scalability
* Easy deployment
* Fast defect detection
* Different technology stacks can be implemented easily.
* increased scope for experiments in technology.
Cons of microservices:
* We need more collaboration
* More complexity
* Need more architecture to set for coding effectively
* causes difficulty in debugging and testing
* It does not have scope for small applications.
Who Is Using Microservices?
Microservices enable the development, scaling, and improvement of software service quality. It has plenty of advantages like accuracy, scalability, easy deployment, and the ability to sustain an application’s efficiency if something goes wrong.
In this way, if something goes down, it will affect the features of that one group, instead of affecting the whole application.
Let’s have a look at the industries using microservices.
The healthcare industry has adopted microservices due to their fast deployment, quicker technology adoption, and increased productivity. Microservices have made a strong foothold in the healthcare industry, and their market is expected to grow from $130 million to $519 million by 2025.
Microservices seize three key features for finance services: terrific security, faster delivery of new functionalities, and easily manageable API layer.
Government organizations can gain a lot from microservices’ increased security and scalability, as they can build functionality to achieve their business goals.
Because of its great scalability and faster error handling, retail companies like Bestbuy.com, Amazon, eBay, Coca-Cola, and so many more have adopted microservices.
Netflix was one of the earliest to evolve in microservices in 2009, and now it handles over 2 billion edge requests in a day. Microservices have given speed, scalability, and availability.
Conclusion -
Microservices came into the light 10 years ago; since then they have been introduced and we have seen their popularity rise in every industry, and now we are seeing them applied on the front end as well.
The future of microservices is visionary and can be unfolded in many different and exciting ways; its great scalability, faster error detection ability, easy deployability, and different tech stack implementation will help developers develop more expandable services that can devour a huge amount of real-time event data and run them by combining all those loosely coupled services as a single application with an event-driven architecture.
As for the future market for microservices, it is growing amazingly. According to Market Research Future, it is growing with a CAGR of 17 percent and will reach $33 billion by 2023.

The Game Development Industry has evolved in a few decades into a billion-dollar industry that can easily outperform the movie industry in terms of gross revenue. The Gaming industry gears up its pace exponentially during the pandemic. By the end of the year, 2020 India had 400 million gamers, up from 2019, according to KPMG research.
As of now India has 556 million gamers and if we talk about countries India has the highest number of gamers after China. The Game Development industry is expected to increase by 32% between 2019-2024.
With the advancement of technology and introduction of metaverse , there will be few trends in coming years.
Future Trends of Game Development
The top Game Development trends –
1. eSports Gaming
2. AR/VR Gaming
3. Cloud Gaming
4. 5G Gaming
5. The Metaverse Gaming
1. eSports -
ESports gaming is continually rising, specifically from the past few years eSports has shown great growth. eSports is basically electric sports using video games, it often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions between professional players as an individual or as a team. Now eSports competitions are held globally, and many countries participate Internationally and domestically. In India also, there are so many eSports organizations that have been founded and doing so well, according to reports India’s eSports market’s annual revenue has increased by 28% and it has been predicted that it will increase by Cloud Data Storage – Its Trends In Future
Posted on June 27, 2022 By Nevrio
Cloud Storage is a platform that allows you to store your data, files, and documents virtually or remotely hosted by third parties that you can later access either through a public or private network connection. Whatever data you transfer to store virtually, becomes the responsibility of the third-party provider. The provider hosts secure, maintenance and ensures that you have access to the data whenever you need it.
Cloud data storage provides so many benefits, from greater accessibility to data backups. It is very cost-effective, and it provides elasticity meaning you can scale up the capacity as your data volume increases and can dial down when needed.
Cloud storage has large numbers of data servers to ensure the constant availability of data, thus if any server fails or requires maintenance then the user can use the other services available to transfer their data.
Types of Cloud Storage -
Cloud storage is a virtual hard drive, it has made it possible for everyone to store their data virtually and access it from anywhere whenever needed. Cloud storage is a versatile system that allows storing data as word documents, files, and in the form of video to access the cloud to process complex data and run applications. To decide which cloud storage is the best to use as per the requirement, let’s have a look at the different types of cloud storage.
1. Private Cloud Storage -
This cloud storage is also called enterprise cloud storage. This cloud runs on the organization’s private network and is protected by one firewall. Companies can store their expensive and large data on this cloud and can scale up or dial down easily according to their need. The major advantage of storing data on private cloud storage is that it provides full control to its owner. The only drawback is that maintaining private cloud storage is its cost of maintenance.
2. Public Cloud Storage -
Public Cloud Storage is maintained or hosted by a different service provider. It can easily be accessed online by the users and anyone else who is authorized by the host. It has very fewer opportunities for customizing the security field because of the different service providers, the major public cloud storage providers are Google Cloud, Amazon Web Cloud, and IBM Cloud. It’s very reliable, affordable, and has zero maintenance cloud storage. Small and mid-size companies can use this to store their data.
3. Hybrid Cloud Storage -
As its name suggests hybrid cloud storage is the combination of both public and private cloud storage. It allows users to store their data with the security of a private cloud and access or process it with the effect of a public cloud. Its security can easily be customized by the users. With the quality of both private cloud and public cloud, it is very affordable, user friendly, and has security features. Hybrid cloud storage is used by large, small, and mid-size companies.
4. Community Cloud Storage -
It is a variation of cloud storage, it provides solutions to specific communities. It provides security to users, so their private data can be secured, it also offers specific tools and features to meet the requirements of the community. This is affordable and easily scalable, it is a great option for health, finance, and legal companies who have strict compliance.
Trends in Cloud Storage -
1. Kubernetes Facilitating Blockchain -
Blockchain is a revolutionary technology and an open source, it provides a shared digital ledger that records accurate transaction data of two companies in a private or public network. It helps organizations to maintain their records accurately without being dependent on any centralized authority. It lets companies deploy and upgrade and maintain containerized infrastructure.
2. Serverless Functions -
Serverless cloud is also known as function – as – a – services (FAAS), it is a cloud computing model in which a provider manages the allocation of computer resources to meet the demand from running applications. Serverless Cloud uses a combination of our [CLI](https://www.serverless.com/cloud/docs/cli), [SDK (Serverless Development Kit)](https://www.serverless.com/cloud/docs/apps), and [Cloud Dashboard](https://www.serverless.com/cloud/docs/dashboard) to easily build, deploy, and monitor your applications.
3. Growth in Cloud Gaming and AR/VR -
In the coming years, we would be witnessing a huge outbreak in cloud gaming. Google’s Stadia and Amazon Luna will shape the future of cloud gaming. The advancement of AR/Vr gaming has made the AR/VR headset (oculus) more accessible.
The cloud-based AR/VR also helps in areas such as data visualization, product designing, etc. Cloud gaming is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years due to new models and hardware availability.
4. AI in Cloud Gaming -
In the next coming years, AI analytics will improve services, predict consumer behavior, and design monetization models. AI is also being applied to the development of novel game control systems. Technology companies will explore new ways to implement AI for Big Data processing, improving business functions and output. A study by IBM states that 65% of businesses agree that AI is critical for business success and strategy.
5. Security and Compliance -
Every company and client is more concerned about their IT security and data compliance. Cloud providers are responding by offering security features and certifications to their users. This has created a huge demand for Secure Access Service Edge and Cloud-based disaster recovery practices.
Secure Access Services Edge – It is a cloud security-based architecture that allows companies to manage and control access and connectivity to their applications. SASE is an approach to IT security that permits organizations to swiftly undertake new cloud services and assure that their systems are protected.
Cloud-based disaster recovery –\*\* Cloud-based disaster recovery uses cloud computing to help organizations to recover their data on an external cloud server. Business uses cloud-based disaster recovery for critical servers and applications like massive databases and ERP systems. It is cost and efficiency.
Conclusion -
Cloud storage gives better security policy, It has been predicted by the [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-11-10-gartner-says-cloud-will-be-the-centerpiece-of-new-digital-experiences)
By 2025, 85% of enterprises will adopt the cloud storage principle. Cloud Storage helps to keep secure the important data of organizational as well as the personal and individual level data. Anyone can access their data whenever they want and it also provides data backup in case of data loss. Cloud computing makes other technology even faster, lighter and accessible for a customer. So without any doubt, cloud storage will be the future in terms of securing and storing personal and organizational data.

Earlier when Covid 19 strikes happened in India the government announced the lockdown immediately, everything got disturbed daily lives, routines, education, travelling etc. . But soon we adjusted everything and started bringing things online, staying at home and having a good time. As all the services were going online so did the education. Well, online learning was always in the talk but after the lockdown, online platforms were the only medium for learning.
So many new Edtech companies were formed and so many already established companies expanded their company and hired many employees. The Edtech companies were at their peak in lockdown
Now the Edtech firms are slowing down and it has now begun to bother the big tech companies.
Recently Unacademic and BYJU’S have laid off over 800 of their employees. Now, these companies are planning to go offline, the Unacademic has planned to enrol up to 15,000 learners in the first batch across its centres in India, it said in a statement.
Now colleges and schools have reopened, students are attending classes and spending most of their time in schools and colleges in offline mode and that has affected the ETECH FIRMS.
Both modes have their own benefits, in my point of view, the offline mode is beneficial for school and college students as the more they get exposed to practical knowledge the more they’ll get to learn. With offline mode they can learn how to be punctual, how to behave, and how to speak, they’ll get so much practical knowledge and they’ll learn about the culture.
On the other hand, online mode is beneficial for working professionals who want to up-skill themselves.

Additionally, it provides employees with the capability to submit job applications within the organization and incorporates a time-tracking feature.
Challanges
When developing an enterprise-level application, organizations frequently grapple with challenges related to data security and accommodating multi-user access. Moreover, scalability is a critical consideration to ensure the app evolves in tandem with the organization’s growth.

PCL Health employs cutting-edge technology to deliver an advanced healthcare monitoring system, ensuring the well-being of your loved ones even from afar. Our goal is to offer you reassurance while equipping healthcare professionals with comprehensive information to deliver optimal care to your family.
Our platform allows care providers to easily schedule telemedicine appointments, enhancing the overall efficiency of caregiving. Additionally, family members can actively participate through calls, chat, or by sharing photographs, fostering a more connected and engaged healthcare experience.
Challanges
The client approached us with the concept of developing a remote healthcare system specifically tailored for the elderly. The primary challenge was to design an architecture that seamlessly connects elderly individuals (patients), their family members (carers), and clinicians on a unified platform.
The healthcare app is designed to monitor and measure various health vitals, including blood pressure, heart rate, SPO2 levels, and sleep patterns. Integrating these monitoring devices into the system presented a second challenge.
The third challenge involved ensuring real-time updates of vital health data between the patient, carer, and the clinical portal, creating a synchronized and responsive communication channel.
Solution
To achieve this, our team developed a solution consisting of:
A patient tablet app – PCL Connect, tailored to meet the specific needs of the elderly, provides seniors with a means to stay connected with their families. Care providers can conveniently schedule telemedicine appointments, enhancing the overall efficiency of caregiving. Family members can engage through calls, chat, or by sharing photographs.
A carer mobile app – PCL’s client app empowers tech-savvy seniors and their loved ones to monitor vital signs and manage health in real-time. Caretakers, using the client app, remain consistently connected and just a tap away from their circle of care, whether it be a carer, doctor, or family member.
A clinician portal – Our Clinician Dashboard serves as a centralized hub, eliminating room for error in health management. Stay alert and prompt with our clinician dashboard, which allows for remote patient monitoring and customizable health alerts.

Challanges
The client came with an idea to creat a centralise platform for the user to manage their NFTs there was ncreasing demand for NFTs, but limited avenues for creators to sell and showcase their work
And also limited plattform for user to connect with other user and share their portfolio.
The client proposed the development of a centralized platform to empower users in managing their NFTs, driven by the growing demand for these digital assets. Despite the increasing interest in NFTs, creators faced challenges in selling and presenting their work, while users lacked suitable platforms for connecting with each other and sharing their portfolios
Solution
To achieve this we first devised a solution to integrate with all the wallets and blockchains to fetch the data and to identify the blockchain which do not provide open APIs to fetch the data we devised a backend solution to fetch and store data.. We developed a frontend application which facilitate user to manage its portfolio, wallets, and to tracks their NFTs it’s price trends. The user also have feature to buy and sell their NFTs and connect to other user by sharing their portfolio link
We also devices an admin panel to manage all the assets, wallets, and data from the blockchains. The system sync and fetch data periodically and helps user to tracks their assets.
To accomplish this, we initially created a solution to seamlessly integrate with all wallets and blockchains, fetching data. For blockchains lacking open APIs, our backend solution efficiently retrieves and stores data. Our frontend application empowers users to manage portfolios and wallets, track NFTs and their price trends, and facilitates buying and selling. Users can connect with others by sharing their portfolio links.
Additionally, we designed an admin panel for centralized management of assets, wallets, and blockchain data. The system synchronizes and fetches data periodically, ensuring users can effectively monitor their assets
